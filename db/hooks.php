 * Hook callbacks for enrol_prereq2.

 * STRANDED-VERSION BANNER: shown to site administrators on every page while the
 * recorded plugin version is higher than the installed files declare (legacy
 * 13-digit numbering fault). Registered at the top of the body rather than on
 * the plugin's own pages because an admin who never opens this plugin still
 * needs to know why Moodle is refusing their updates. On Moodle versions older
 * than 4.3 (no hooks API) this file is ignored and the repair page at
 * /enrol/prereq2/version_repair.php remains reachable directly.
